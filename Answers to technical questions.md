How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
	A- Spent approximately 3 hours for requirement analysis and automating test cases which included required tool configurations. I would have added data driven approah by extracting data from worksheet. Implementation would have included ExtentReports and Log4j for reporting and trouble shooting.

What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
	A- In sprint automation and integration with devops pipeline.

How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
	A- Yes, I have automated mainframe ISPF navigations and commands using excel VBA. I also tried automating CICS applications using VBA. In both cases host explorer was used as the driver to connect to legacy systems.

How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
	A- I would think of providing customized results using browser cookies. Search results can be tailored rather than showing the entire results. This would increase the responsiveness of the search results page. Complete list needs to be provided only if user is interested. Reorder functionality with single button click can be considered.
